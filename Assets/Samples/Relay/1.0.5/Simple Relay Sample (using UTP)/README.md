# Simple Relay using UTP Sample

This is a Unity sample demonstrating how to initialize and persist a Relay allocation over the Unity Transport Package layer (UTP).
Note that Relay allocations can alternatively be utilized over other 3rd party transport layer services instead of UTP, but such integrations are not shown in this sample.

## Prerequisites

Your current Unity project needs to be initialized on the Unity Dashboard with Relay enabled. Follow the below steps to do so:
* Login to [Unity Dashboard][1].
* Create a project or open a pre-existing project.
* Navigate to `Relay` (under `Multiplayer` in the left navigation panel). Follow the `Getting Started` steps and make sure `Relay` is enabled (`Relay On` toggle).
* Open project in Unity 2020.3.12f1+.
* Link the Unity project to your project and organization (in `Project Settings > Services`).

## Using this sample

Open the project with the Unity editor (2020.3.12f1+), then open the `SimpleRelayUtp` scene.

This sample is meant to be used with at least 2 separate clients. One for the Host, and the other(s) for the joining Player(s).

To run multiple clients on the same machine, we recommend either building the project into an executable binary, or with ParrelSync[2].
If you choose to build the project into a binary, the binary can be used in conjunction with the open editor, or with cloned binaries.

Upon playing the scene, you are presented with starting the client as either a Host who initiates the game session, or as a joining Player.

The flow for the Host is as follows:
- Sign in
- Get regions (optional)
- Select region (optional)
- Allocate game session
- Bind to the selected Relay server
- Get join code

The join code is shared with joining players. After they join and connect to the Host, the Host can:
- Send messages to all connected players
- Disconnect all connected players

The flow for a Player is as follows:
- Sign in
- Join game session using the Host's join code
- Bind to the selected Relay server
- Request a connection to the Host

Once connected to the Host, a player can:
- Send a message to the Host
- Disconnect from the Host
